# Arduino-Relay-Controller
Simplistic relay controller made using arduino. Activation of relay is decided by pressing the push button or sensor readings (in this module sensors are replaced with another push buttons).

To activate the relays, one must press the button available on the circuit (4 buttons on the left) while the 4 buttons on the right could be replaced with
sensors as an alternative to manual activation using push buttons.

The project was made in TinkerCAD in this following link:
